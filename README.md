# What Is Financial Technology – Fintech?
Financial technology (Fintech) is used to describe new tech that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services. ​​​At its core, fintech is utilized to help companies, business owners and consumers better manage their financial operations, processes, and lives by utilizing specialized software and algorithms that are used on computers and, increasingly, smartphones. Fintech, the word, is a combination of "financial technology". 

Fintech also includes the development and use of crypto-currencies. While that segment of fintech may see the most headlines, the big money still lies in the traditional global banking industry and its multi-trillion-dollar market capitalization.

# How does fintech work?
Fintech is not a new industry, it’s just one that has evolved very quickly. Technology has, to some degree, always been part of the financial world, whether it's the introduction of credit cards in the 1950s or ATMs, electronic trading floors, personal finance apps and high-frequency trading in the decades that followed.

The guts behind financial technology varies from project to project, application to application. Some of the newest advances, however, are utilizing machine learning algorithms, blockchain and data science to do everything from process credit risks to run hedge funds. In fact, there's now an entire subset of regulatory technology dubbed "regtech" designed to navigate the complex world of compliance and regulatory issues of industries.

# Banking
Mobile banking is a large part of the fintech industry. In the world of personal finance, consumers have increasingly demanded easy digital access to their bank accounts, especially on a mobile device. Most major banks now offer some kind of mobile banking feature, especially with the rise of digital-first banks, or "Neobanks".

Neobanks are essentially banks without any physical branch locations, serving customers with checking, savings, payment services and loans on completely mobile and digital infrastructure. Some examples of neobanks are Chime, Simple and Varo.

# Cryptocurrency & Blockchain
Running parallel to fintech is the birth of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Blockchain is the technology that allows cryptocurrency mining and marketplaces to exist, while advancements in cryptocurrency technology can be attributed to both blockchain and fintech. Though blockchain and cryptocurrency are unique technologies that can be considered outside the realm of fintech, in theory, both are necessary to create practical applications that move fintech forward.

# Investment & Savings
Fintech has caused an explosion in the number of investing and savings apps in recent years. More than ever, the barriers to investing are being broken down by companies like Robinhood, Stash and Acorns. While these apps differ in approach, each uses a combination of savings and automated small-dollar investing methods, such as instant round-up deposits on purchases, to introduce consumers to the markets. 

Machine Learning & Trading
Being able to predict where markets are headed is the Holy Grail of finance. With billions of dollars to be made, it's no surprise machine learning has played an increasingly important role in fintech. The power of this AI-subset lies in its ability to run massive amounts of data through algorithms designed to spot trends and risks, allowing consumers, companies, banks and additional organizations to have a more informed understanding of investment and purchasing risks earlier on in the process.

# Payments
Moving money around is something fintech is very good at. The phrase “I’ll Venmo you” is now a replacement for “I’ll pay you later.” Venmo, of course, is a go-to mobile payment platform. Payment companies have changed the way we all do business. It's easier than ever to send money digitally anywhere in the world. In addition to Venmo, popular payment companies include Zelle, Paypal, Stripe and Square.
