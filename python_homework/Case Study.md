## Background 
    In 2019 J.P. Morgan was the first global bank to design a netowrk to facilitate instantaneous payments using blockchain technology, having access to facilitate payments 24/7 365, business-to-business transactions by using the JPM Coin.

## What is JPM Coin
    JPM coin is a permissioned, shared ledger that serves as a payment rail and deposit account ledger. It enables particapating J.P. Morgan clients to transfer US Dollars that are held in deposit with J.P. Morgan. The JPM coin facilitates real time value movement. The JPM coin is trying to tackle cross-boarder payments issue. The JPM coin is trying to address the challenges of cross boarder payments and simplifying it.
# Technology
      JPM coin uses Ethereum as it's choice of blockchain to conduct its business model and solve crossborder payment issues. Etherem is a proof of wrok blockchain. This means that the consinsus algorithum uses mining. Mining Etherum requiers GPU graphic cards. This can be taxing because proof of work needs real world resources to scale. The miners, are people or companies who opperate the mining rigs. Whoever has the most hashpower gets the block reward. 

# Limitations
      If one were to control majority of the hashpower it would make Ethereum centralized because the top miners have the most haspower. Other limitations with proof of work are the gas fees associated with it. Gas fees are essectially that, a fee for participating on the Ethereum network. When users us Ethereum as a currency it is called Eth and there is a fee that the miners take for upholding the network. When the price of Ethereum rises higher so do the gas fees. This makes it hard for company to scale their business using the Ethereum Network. 
  
 # Fixes
      With the issues of proof of work, there are other protocols that us less intensive consensus algorithems and little to no real world resources in order to compete for the hashpower. Proof of Stake is less intensive and doesn't us real world resources to validate the blocks on the blockchain. Instead, proof of stake uses the tokens as a controll mechanism to validate the blocks on the blockchain. Users or nodes who hold the token get rewards back in that native cryptocurrency. It is much more decentralized and cheeper to conduct business and launch various products. Proof of stake is, faster, cheeper, & more secure. Since Ethereum has issues with proof of work, it is trying to convert over to proof of stake. The scaleing issue of proof of work has opened the door to new competetors in the blockchain space.

# Competitor Background
      With cross border payment being a key issue for banks, big coorporations and financial institutions, there is a demanding need for cheeper ways of transfurance of money. Companies and people have to wait for settlements of up to 3-5 business days for accounts to settle. Sometimes accounts have to be pre-funded in order to conduct a transaction. Remittances is another issue for migrant workers as well who's currency is debased. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement currency exchange and remittance network. Ripple is built on a distributed open source protocol and supports tokens repsenting fiat currencies, commodities and crypto's. In order to facilitate all of the needs of a institution or business, the ledger uses a crypto called XRP, which is faster and more secure. XRP is used by a Federated Byzatine Agreement which uses consensus by nodes and doesn't require proof of work to validate the transactions.
